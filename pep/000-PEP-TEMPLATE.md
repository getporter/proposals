## Abstract

<!--
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
-->


## Motivation

<!--
It should clearly explain why Porter's existing functionality is inadequate to
address the problem that the PEP solves and identify the impacted audience(s) (mixin
developers, bundle authors, end-users). PEP submissions without sufficient
motivation may be rejected outright. This is the most important part at the
beginning and is required before moving forward.
-->


## Rationale

<!--
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing why particular design
decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered
and related work.

The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and
discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
-->


## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the command and/or configuration
syntax and semantics of any new feature.

* If this is a command, we are looking for what the `porter help` would look
  like: description of command, arguments, flags, default behavior and error
  handling.

* If this is a syntax change to a configuration file, define the allowed syntax,
  at least one example per use case, covering defaults and error handling.

* All PEPs will be reviewed for user experience. So make sure to think about the
  common use case, how people can accomplish more advanced scenarios, precedence
  from existing Porter features or other tools in the ecosystem, and how the
  change fits into Porter workflows and tasks.

The spec should be detailed enough that someone other than the PEP
authors can understand what needs to be implemented.
-->


## Implementation

<!--
After the PEP status is changed to implementable, when the PEP has been
implemented link to the pull request(s) here.
-->


## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All PEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section
describing these incompatibilities and their severity.  The PEP must explain how
to deal with these incompatibilities, possibly with defaulting or migrations.
PEP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be
rejected outright.
-->


## Security Implications

<!--
If there are security concerns in relation to the PEP, those concerns should be
explicitly written out to make sure reviewers of the PEP are aware of them.
Mitigations should be included if possible.
-->


## Rejected Ideas

<!--
Throughout the discussion of a PEP, various ideas will be proposed which are not
accepted. Those rejected ideas should be recorded along with the reasoning as to
why they were rejected. This both helps record the thought process behind the
final version of the PEP as well as preventing people from bringing up the same
rejected idea again in subsequent discussions.
-->


## Open Questions

<!--
Before a PEP is implemented, questions can come up which warrant further discussion.
Those questions should be recorded here so people know that they are being
thought about but do not have a concrete resolution. This ensures all concerns
are addressed prior to accepting the PEP and reduces repeating prior discussion.
When possible, link the question to where it is being discussed, such as a
[forum] post/comment.
